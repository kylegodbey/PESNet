# PESNet
Playing with Neural Nets for PESes. Right now using standard NN from Keras.

## Gaussian Process

In the future, Gaussian Process Emulation will be explored using memory efficient GPU implementations for PES emulation. The benefit here is better quantified uncertainty in the generated PESes without a huge performance hit.
